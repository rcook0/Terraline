True concurrency: 
Every selected active zone can run its own episode in parallel, with its own priors/scores/posteriors, and independent completion + validation + alerts.

What you get:

Multiple simultaneous episodes 
(e.g., price inside a support zone while also tagging a resistance zone? both can be “live”.)

Panel auto-focuses on the “most intense” live episode (highest current confidence). 
If none are live, it shows the most recently completed episode.

Alerts fire if any zone completes an episode this bar and matches your class + confidence threshold.
