True concurrency: 
Every selected active zone can run its own episode in parallel, with its own priors/scores/posteriors, and independent completion + validation + alerts.

Multiple simultaneous episodes 
(e.g., price inside a support zone while also tagging a resistance zone? both can be “live”.)

Panel auto-focuses on the “most intense” live episode (highest current confidence). 
If none are live, it shows the most recently completed episode.

Alerts fire if any zone completes an episode this bar and matches your class + confidence threshold.

Notes:

Concurrency scope: episodes are maintained for the currently selected zones (nearest supports/resistances). 
That’s intentional to avoid TV limits. Increase keepSup/keepRes if you want more parallelism.

Validated-only behavior:
Show only validated zones affects drawing.
Select only validated zones affects which zones can run episodes / touch tracking.

Panel focus logic: shows the live episode with the highest current confidence; otherwise the last completed episode.
