State-aware zone scoring

Selection is no longer “closest zone wins.”
Each candidate zone gets a score:

Base preference for being close (distance / ATR)
Validated zones get a small bump
Fresh zones (low touch pressure) get a bump
Role-switch zones get state-dependent nudges:
- CONFIRMED flip (F) gets a big bump
- WEAK (W) gets a smaller bump
- TRAP (T) only gets a bump when context makes sense (BB extreme and/or squeeze), and gets nerfed during band-walk trends
- FAIL (!) and REJECTED (J) get penalties

Active “boost touches” still help, but as an explicit score bump (not a hacky distance divider)

So v7 starts behaving like a human: “yeah it’s close, but it’s a failed flip in a band-walk trend… ignore it.”
