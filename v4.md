1) Top-1 / Top-3 panel mode
Shows live zone episodes ranked by current confidence (dominant posterior).
If no live episodes, it shows last completed.

3) Cooldown
After an episode completes for a zone, the zone won’t start a new episode until cooldownBars have passed.
This stops “machine-gun relabeling” during chop.

5) Zone retirement
If an episode resolves as SLICE with confidence ≥ retireConf and price holds beyond the zone for retireHoldBars, the zone is marked retired and is skipped from selection.
Optionally tinted grey on chart.
