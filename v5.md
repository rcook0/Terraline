“Post-break role switch”  
When a zone retires via Slice, automatically create a new zone on the other side (role reversal) 
and treat the first retest as a high-signal event. 
- breakouts become tradable.

When a zone retires via SLICE (high confidence + hold), the script immediately creates a new, tighter role-switch zone:
- Break above old resistance → new support zone centered on the old zone’s top (zh)
- Break below old support → new resistance zone centered on the old zone’s bottom (zl)

That new zone is tagged R in the panel, and ! while its first retest is still “armed”.

On the first retest, the episode’s priors get nudged toward:
- ACCEPT + COMPRESS (continuation / successful retest)
- with a small penalty to SLICE (so you need real evidence to call “failed retest”)

Breakouts become structural objects that can be traded on the retest, instead of “a scary candle that ran away.”
